# code-quiz

Created a webpage where users can take a timed quiz. Once they start the quiz the timer sets to 60 secs. If they get the questions wrong the timer will -10 seconds and take you to the next question. The end of the quiz the time that is left over will be the final score which will be saved into local storage with the user initials.
